feat: Implement various feature enhancements and UI improvements

This commit includes several enhancements and bug fixes across the application,
primarily focusing on robustness, UI/UX, and code structure:

- **Robustness**: Introduced _isDisposed pattern in controllers (add_review_controller.dart, edit_review_controller.dart, profile_screen_controller.dart) to prevent state updates after disposal.
- **Image Handling**:
    - Added image optimization options (maxWidth, maxHeight, imageQuality) to ImagePicker calls in add_review_controller.dart and edit_review_controller.dart.
    - Implemented logic to remove old images from Supabase Storage upon new image upload in edit_review_controller.dart and profile_screen_controller.dart.
- **Navigation**: Extracted bottom navigation into a reusable CommonBottomNavBar widget (lib/presentation/widgets/common_bottom_nav_bar.dart), now integrated into home_screen.dart, profile_screen.dart, and search_screen.dart.
- **UI/UX Improvements**:
    - **ProfileScreen**: Enhanced initial loading UI, added username validation, and implemented a manual refresh button.
    - **SearchScreen**: Refactored star rating display into a reusable widget and improved error/no results display.
    - **General**: Updated error messages and other UI texts to be localized (Japanese).
- **Data Freshness**: Added forceUpdate parameter to fetchProducts calls in home_screen.dart to ensure data is fresh.
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed numerous Japanese comments from various files.
